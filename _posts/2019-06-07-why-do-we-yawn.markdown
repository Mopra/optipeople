There are several explanations for us yawning. You may have already discovered that you often yawn as a reflex of others around you yawning. At the same time, you will also find that when you talk or read about yawning, you will get an increasing desire to yawn. It is quite natural.

Lack of oxygen in the body has so far been one of the most frequent explanations for why you yawn. The reason for this is that when you yawn, the body absorbs more oxygen. This theory has subsequently been questioned. This is because of fetuses also gabber, and as they do not breathe oxygen through the lungs, you probably do not go because of lack of oxygen.
<br><br>
Another explanation is that you yawn to stretch the jaw and face muscles. Just as it is important to stretch in the morning to get started in the body, a gap helps to get the facial muscles started.

A yawn typically lasts 6 seconds. But you don't just yawn because you're tired. If your brain is not stimulated, you start to get bored and it causes the temperature of the brain to rise, which can result in you experiencing a greater urge to yawn.

If you suffer from migraines, you will probably tend to yawn more. This is because, in the case of migraine attacks, blood accumulates in the brain, which is cooled when you yawn.

One of the newest theories is that you yawn to keep your brain cool. As you yawn, you increase the heart rate and blood flow, which helps keep your brain cool. This theory has been substantiated by a study that states that people are less caring in winter than in summer. As the temperature rises, you will automatically yawn more.

A smile is contagious, but so is a yawn too. You've probably taken yourself to yawn because you've seen other yawns. There are different theories as to why it is infecting when we yawn. One of the explanations is that it is probably due to the human instinct that it is important that the "herd" has the same circadian rhythm. Another explanation is that you show empathy when you yawn with others.
