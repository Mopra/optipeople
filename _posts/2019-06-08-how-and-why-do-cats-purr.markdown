When you sit with a cat in your lap and stroke it, it often makes it purr. But where does the sound come from and why does it purr at all?
<br><br>
Most people like the humming of a cat purring - also the cat itself. In fact, cats may use the sound to calm themselves and their offspring and signal security. Cats can purr when they are a few weeks old.
<br><br>
Cats are some special little creatures. They can hiss, they can pull the pupils together, they can always land on the legs. And then they can purr..

<p>
The purring sound occurs when air passes vibrating muscles in the larynx. The muscles correspond to the cat's vocal cords.
<br><br>
Other elements, such as the cavity of the cat's larynx, the so-called resonance space and the cat's tongue bone, are also likely to create the rumbling sound.
<br><br>
The vibration of the muscles is due to a rhythmic nerve impulse that the cat does not control in the same way as when it makes other sounds, such as a “mew”.
<br><br>
The cat spins both consciously and unconsciously.
<br><br>
The purring sound can continue uninterrupted because it is produced both by exhalation and inhalation. Spindle sounds are independent of the other sounds the cat can make, and a cat can both spin and “mew” at the same time.
