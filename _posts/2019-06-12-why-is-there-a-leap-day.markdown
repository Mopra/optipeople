<p>
Every fourth year we have what we call a leap year (or intercalary year). A leap year is when we add an additional day to the calendar, so we get 366 days instead of 365 days.
<br><br>
We add the leap day because a day is not exactly 24 hours. The average number of days per year is 365.2. So every four years we add an extra day to compensate. The day we add is added to February, so instead of having 28 days in February, we have 29 in leap years.

The Roman Emperor Julius Caesar was the first to try to find a solution to the mess in the calendar.
<br><br>
In the year 46 before our time, the calendar was eventually 67 days behind the season, which caused great confusion among the farmers.
<br><br>
It caused Caesar to extend the year 46 by 67 days extra plus a leap month of 23 days. The year, which consisted of 445 days, was named Annus Confusionis - Year of Confusion - by the Romans.
<br><br>
The length of the months was adjusted the following year so that together they constituted a year of 365 days. That February is shorter than the other months is thus a remnant from the Roman calendar, where you just spent February to insert an extra day - a leap day.
<br><br>
Contrary to popular belief, February 29 is not the actual shooting day, but February 24th.
This is because February in the Roman, Julian calendar only consisted of 23 days, which made February 24 the actual shooting day.

<p>
Julius Caesar's calendar was not exactly accurate. On average, a Julian year lasted 365.25 days, but an astronomical year lasted only 365.2421978 days.
<br><br>
This meant that the calendar year and the astronomical year were not followed, and in 1582 Pope Gregory 13. decided to do something about the problem.
<br><br>
He introduced the Gregorian calendar, which adjusted the number of leap years so that there are only 97 leap years in 400 years.
<br><br>
The calendar Gregorian calendar, is however not flawless.
For every 10,000 years, there will be an error of 3 days in the calendar. The next shift of one day takes place in the year 5153. So there is enough time to come up with a solution.
