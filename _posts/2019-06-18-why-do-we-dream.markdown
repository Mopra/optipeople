There have been a lot of theories about dreaming since prehistory. Stories from many cultures credit dreams with important events. The Egyptians and Greeks were well known for this as were the other cultures in the region.
<br><br>
There has been some research done in modern times about why we dream.Most dreams happen during the REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep. This is the lightest stage and the eye movements may be in response to what is being dreamt.
<br><br>
Modern theories of dreams start with therapy. Life is full of emotional events, both good and bad. Dreams help deal with those emotions which we may keep a tight rein on when we are awake. This may also be the cause of some nightmares.
<br><br>
Fight or flight training is another theory. There is a portion of the brain that deals with this phenomenon. During a dream it is the most active part of the brain. While some people do move in their sleep because of this they aren’t as likely to be able to hit or kick anyone. The same part of the brain sends out muscle relaxing signals to prevent it.
<br><br>
Many creative people say that their dreams are what give them their best work. The theory is that the filters that we keep on our thoughts when we are awake are gone during dreams. That allows us to dream of things that we would think of as silly while awake.
<br><br>
Research into dreaming shows that it helps store memories. The terms “sleep on it” and “cram session” both indicate that there is a connection. It is far easier to remember something new when it is learned just before sleep.
<br><br>
There are a few other things that may cause dreams. Some mental health conditions can cause more dreaming as well as pregnancy. People are more likely to dream after a few restless nights and when the take some medications. Trazadone is well known for causing intense dreams both good and bad.
