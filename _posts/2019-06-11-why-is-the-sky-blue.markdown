<p>
Every day we look upon a blue sky, how can this be?
<br><br>
On the way down to the Earth's surface, the light with the shortest wavelengths experiences the strongest spread. The blue light is the most short-wave colour in the visible spectrum, and therefore much more blue light is scattered into the sky than light in all other colours.
<br><br>
These are the smallest molecules in the atmosphere, such as oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2), which spread the colours of the light differently. Larger particles such as water or dust scatter light largely independent of the colour of light.
<br><br>
It is, therefore, possible to judge the amount of water in the atmosphere by looking at how light blue the colour really is. In an extremely dry polar air, the sky seems almost black-blue, and in our eyes, the bluest sky is in fact often blended with some other colours - that is, white light - to work really blue. In air masses, which for a long time have been given water vapour from hot sea water, the sky becomes almost whitish, and the favouring of the blue colour is completely overshadowed by a stronger reflection of the entire colour spectrum.
<br><br>
The spread, which favours the blue light, which has shorter wavelengths than the red light, is called Rayleigh scattering. The size of the molecules that scatter the light is relatively close to the wavelength of the light. The blue spectrum is approximately between 4000 and 5000 angstroms, while for example, red light has a wavelength of approximately 7000 angstroms, where one angstrom corresponds to 10 -10 meters.
<br><br>
The Rayleigh spread is also the cause of another, equally well-known phenomenon - the red sun decline. Here the sun's path through the atmosphere is so long that only the most steady colour is left - namely red.
