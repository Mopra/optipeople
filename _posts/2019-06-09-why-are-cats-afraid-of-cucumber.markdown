Videos of cats jumping for life after meeting with a cucumber have run out on Facebook. But how can cats be afraid of cucumbers?
<br><br>
With stoic calm, the cat stands and eats from his food bowl. But the moment it takes its head off the bowl and looks over its shoulder, hell breaks loose. The cat jumps almost several feet into the air in sheer horror: It has seen a cucumber!

Videos of cats who are afraid of cucumbers have taken the Internet by storm. But how does it work, and can it really be that the little lions are afraid of the oblong vegetable?
<br><br>
There is no definitive answer, as it has not been researched whether cats are afraid of cucumbers. But there is a good idea why the cats react so violently.

In the videos, the cats are well off with a meal without knowing that their owners have placed a cucumber behind them. And according to Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behaviour, it is precisely in the surprise moment that the cause of the violent reaction must be found.
<br><br>
"I think the answer lies in the fact that the cats find an unexpected object that has been secretly placed while they were in the bowl. Cats are suspicious of anything unknown. The unknown can be another predator, such as a snake, ”he told The Telegraph.
<br><br>
"I guess the result would be the same if the cucumber was replaced with something else. For example, it could be a plastic fish or a mask, ”says Roger Mugford.
