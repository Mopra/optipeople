Do you often ask yourself, why am I always tired?
<br><br>
When you feel tired every day, you probably blame your busy lifestyle or the dark season, but if so, you should actually ask yourself why you are so tired all the time and not just ignore it.
<br><br>
Of course, your fatigue may be due to not getting enough sleep, and your social calendar is fully booked, but it may also be due to more serious things than just that. We have collected six possible diseases that make you experience fatigue. If you can recognize any of these symptoms, we encourage you to seek medical attention.

Getting anaemia is due to a lack of red blood cells that bring oxygen to your lungs. If this is the case, you will feel tired while feeling breathless and weak. Anaemia may be due to iron deficiency or another form of vitamin deficiency.
<br><br>
Symptoms: In addition to fatigue, shortness of breath and weakness, you may also experience headaches, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, and even small tasks and exercises will exhaust you.

Your thyroid gland, which sits in the throat, secretes hormones, and if these hormones are not excreted in the right amount, even normal everyday activities will make you tired. The thyroid gland regulates your metabolism, so if it secretes too many hormones, your metabolism will increase, and if it secretes too little, your metabolism will fall.
<br><br>
Symptoms: Thyroid disease causes weak and tired muscles - initially you can feel it in the thighs. You can also experience unexplained weight loss and you can feel warm all the time. The opposite can also happen where you experience weight gain because your body is filled with water and you freeze. The last one happens mostly for women over 50.

Many are diagnosed with diabetes each year, but many more do not know that they have the disease at all. Our bodies run on glucose, which is a problem for people with type 2 diabetes, as they have reduced sugar tolerance, leading to high levels of glucose in the blood.
<br><br>
Symptoms: In addition to massive fatigue, you may also feel very thirsty and hungry. You can also experience constant tissue penetration, weight loss, fungal infections and blurred vision.

Depression affects all feelings that concern ourselves and others. If the depression is not treated, it can last a long time - even several years.
<br><br>
Symptoms: There are no fixed symptoms of depression since all people experience it differently, however, it can cause you to feel drained of energy, problems with your concentration and memory, altered sleep patterns, and negative emotions.

We are happy to say that our teenager, who preferably sleeps 15 hours a day, suffers from chronic fatigue, but it is actually a real disease that makes you feel very tired and even the smallest things can exhaust you. There is still no definite reason why chronic fatigue occurs in the body, so the disease is still a bit of a mystery.
<br><br>
Symptoms: You feel tired and you may experience headaches, muscle and joint pain and difficulty concentrating.

Sleep apnea is a disorder where your breathing is interrupted for a few seconds while you sleep. Your upper respiratory tract actually closes and collapses. These interruptions help to make your brain panic, causing you to wake up so you can breathe normally again.
<br><br>
Symptoms: The most common symptoms are that you snore and you are very tired the next day. It may sound quite harmless, but it can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.
