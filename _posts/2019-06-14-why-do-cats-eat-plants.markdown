Have you ever come home to see your houseplants once again ravaged by the cat?  Why do cats eat grass and houseplants?  Even more important, will it hurt them.
<br><br>
Cats are mostly meat eaters.  That doesn’t mean it is the only thing they eat.  Even in the wild cats will eat plants.  Part of it a need for more fibre in their diet but also they need to have balanced nutrition.  Some nutrients are only found in plants.
<br><br>
There are other reasons why cats eat plants, especially housecats.  Veterinarians think that some cats eat grass when they have digestive problems.  Others may eat it to get rid of intestinal parasites. There are cats who just like to chew things and others who get upset or bored when there aren’t any people around.
<br><br>
As to whether or not it will hurt them, it depends on the plant.  Grass won’t hurt them at all. Many people buy cat grass just so their indoor-only cats have a chance to munch on it. Other plants, like philodendrons, have a chemical in them that can cause tiny cuts throughout their digestive system.  A few plants are actually deadly.  Chives and all lilies are severely poisonous.
<br><br>
The best thing to do if you love your houseplants and your cat is to keep them out of its reach.  That’s hard with a cat but it can be done.  If the cat is eating plants on a daily basis it may be time to see the veterinarian make sure there aren’t other issues.
<br><br>
Ask the veterinarian about how to help a cat that is bored or upset.  There are toys that may help and pheromone products such as Feliway are very useful.
